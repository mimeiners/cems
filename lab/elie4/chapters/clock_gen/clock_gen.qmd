## Clock-Phase generation

The aforementioned delay in the phases of the clocks acting on the switched capacitor can be achieved by the structure
in @fig-phase_gen. This takes a reference clock signal which provides a signal at the frequency required by the system
and outputs four different phases $\phi_1$, $\phi_{1d}$, $\phi_2$ and $\phi_{2d}$. The feedback between the upper and
lower strand of the structure, in conjunction with the NAND gates, ensures the prevention of overlap between $\phi_1$
and $\phi_2$ and in turn for their respective delayed versions.

By changing the capacitance of the marked inverters the actual delay between $\phi_i$ and $\phi_{id}$ can be controlled.
[@schreier] It is worth noting however, that the capacitive load $C_L$ experienced at the outputs of the structure also
has an influence on the phase delay.

@fig-delay_norm shows the normal delay between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_{1d}$ as well as the non-overlap with $\phi_2$. 
The structure used for clock generation was modeled after the circuit provided by [@murmann]. In this, 
they used the *sg13g2* standard cells for the NAND gates and inverters which are not built from single transistors and 
hence their capacitance can not be changed. Simulations with different values for the load capacitances have proven to
not impair the structures functionality. We thus continue with this non-transitorized version, since creating the gates
from scratch would add unnecessary complexity.
