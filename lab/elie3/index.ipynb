    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital world, **Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)** are everywhere—from smartphones and medical devices to industrial sensors and audio systems. They convert real-world analog signals, like sound and motion, into digital data that computers can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful types of ADCs is the **Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM)**, known for its **high accuracy and noise reduction**. Unlike traditional ADCs, DSMs use **oversampling and feedback loops** to improve signal quality, making them ideal for applications that require precision, such as **communication systems, and high-fidelity audio processing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Document Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This work explores the **design, implementation, and analysis of Delta-Sigma ADCs** through both theory and hands-on experimentation. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How ADCs work**, including key components like filters, samplers, and quantizers.\n",
    "**Types of ADCs**, including Flash, Successive Approximation, and Delta-Sigma.\n",
    "**The practical design of a Delta-Sigma ADC system**, integrating:\n",
    "-ADXL335 Accelerometer for motion sensing.\n",
    "-ADS1115 ADC for signal conversion.\n",
    "-ESP8266 Microcontroller for data processing and display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circuit design and simulations using MATLAB/Simulink, LTSpice, and Xschem** to model and test ADC performance along with findings and challenges have been documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Delta-Sigma ADCs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta-Sigma ADCs stand out because they **filter out noise, enhance precision, and are cost-effective**. They use a clever trick—**oversampling**—to capture more signal details than conventional ADCs, making them ideal for low-frequency, high-accuracy applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **System Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation presents the **design and implementation** of a **Delta Sigma Modulator**. The system successfully captures real-time acceleration data, converts it into digital form, processes it using a microcontroller, and visualizes the results on a screen. The primary focus was the **ADC subsystem**, particularly the **custom Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM)** integrated within the ADS1115, replacing the standard comparator with a **5T OTA** in the design of **1st order and 2nd order DSM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system comprises the following components: - **ADXL335 Accelerometer** for motion sensing. - **ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** for high-resolution signal conversion. - **ESP8266 Microcontroller** for processing and data transmission. - **Custom Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM) with a 5T Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA)** to replace ADC.\n",

    "  A[\"Accelerometer\"] --> B[/Analog to Digital convertor/] --> C[\"Microcontroller\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of three main blocks: an **accelerometer**, an **analog-to-digital converter (ADC)**, and a **microcontroller**. The accelerometer detects motion and generates analog voltage signals corresponding to acceleration in three axes (X, Y, and Z). These analog signals are then fed into the ADC, which converts them into a digital format for further processing. Finally, the microcontroller receives the digitized data, processes it, and transmits the results for visualization or further analysis.\n",

The accelerometer, ADC, and microcontroller are wired to facilitate seamless communication. This physical setup validates the theoretical design and allows for real-time testing and evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### System Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM) is a key component in analog-to-digital conversion. It works by oversampling an input signal and shaping the quantization noise to high frequencies outside the signal bandwidth. This allows for increased resolution within the desired bandwidth after digital filtering and downsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Input Signal:** A sine wave used as the test input.\n",
    "-   **Noise Transfer Function (NTF):** Shapes the quantization noise.\n",
    "-   **Quantizer:** Produces a discrete output.\n",
    "-   **Feedback Loop:** Ensures stability and improves accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **1st Order DSM** consists of a single integrator in the feedback loop. The noise shaping improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by pushing the quantization noise to higher frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",

    "u = A * sin(2 * pi * fx * t); % Input sinewave signal\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The significant difference in performance arises from the non-ideal characteristics of the 5T OTA compared to the ideal op-amp:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Finite Gain and Bandwidth:** The 5T OTA has limited gain and bandwidth, leading to non-ideal integration behavior and reduced signal swing.\n",
    "-   **Non-Linearities:** The 5T OTA exhibits non-linearities, especially for larger signal swings, distorting the integrated waveform.\n",
    "-   **Noise:** The 5T OTA is more susceptible to noise due to factors like transistor mismatch and thermal noise, resulting in a noisy comparator output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Nearly the Same\" Digital Output\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *general* pattern of the digital output (V(vq) or V(Vx1)) appears similar in some respects (especially when considering long timescales or slowly varying inputs), a detailed examination reveals significant performance degradation with the 5T OTA:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Average Switching Frequency:** The average switching frequency might be close, but the *instantaneous* switching times are much more irregular and noisy.\n",
    "-   **Noise and Distortion:** Even if the pulse *density* seems similar, the noise and jitter in the 5T OTA output will severely impact the accuracy of the digital representation. This noise will be apparent in the frequency spectrum.\n",
    "-   **Performance Metrics:** Metrics like SNR and THD will be drastically worse with the 5T OTA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DSM2 Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "The OTA **failed to meet performance requirements**. DSM2, being a second-order modulator, has an additional level of feedback and increased complexity in its loop dynamics. A higher gain is often needed to maintain the accuracy of the feedback in DSM2.\n",

    "#### Expected Integrator Output:\n",
    "- Ideally, an integrator should produce a **triangular wave** when driven by a square wave input.\n",
    "- The integration process converts the high and low levels of the input pulse into a continuous increase or decrease in output voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observed Output:\n",
    "- The output waveform starts high and gradually **decreases over time**, rather than forming a clear triangular wave.\n",
    "- Instead of oscillating symmetrically, the **output drifts downward**, indicating a **DC bias shift**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons for Output Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- *DC Bias Shift (Leakage Effects)* The exponential downward drift indicates that the capacitor is *losing charge over time*.\n",
    "- *OTA Non-Idealities* Different design approaches need to be explored for OTA.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta-Sigma ADCs have proven to be a **powerful and efficient** solution for high-precision signal conversion. Their ability to **reduce noise, improve resolution, and handle low-frequency signals** makes them ideal for applications in **medical devices, audio processing, and industrial sensors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we explored the **fundamentals of ADCs**, the **inner workings of Delta-Sigma Modulators**, and their **real-world applications**. We also **simulated** a Delta-Sigma ADC system using key components like the **ADXL335 accelerometer, ADS1115 ADC, and ESP8266 microcontroller**, ensuring practical insights into how these systems function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through simulations in **MATLAB, LTSpice, and Xschem**, we analyzed different ADC architectures, comparing **first and second-order Delta-Sigma Modulators** to understand their trade-offs between **accuracy, stability, and complexity**.\n"
