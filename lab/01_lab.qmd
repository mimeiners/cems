# Model-Based Systems Engineering for an Inertial Sensor System

## Design Project

* System level, behavioural model 
  * Matlab/Simulink, 
  * Python 
  * HDL (Verilog-ams, VHDL-AMS)

* Circuit level, SPICE with behavioural blocks, e.g. OTA and comparator

* PCB level
  * [ESP8266 NodeMCU](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp8266-wifi-transceiver-review/),
  * [TIs ADS1115](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115), 
  * [ADs ADXL335](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adxl335.html)

* IC level

## Design Project Flow

* Literature research in journals, professional (serious) internet forums (e.g. application notes of semiconductor
  companies) and library 

* Set-up bibliography, e.g. [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org),
  [Citavi](https://www.suub.uni-bremen.de/literatur-verwalten/refworks/citavi/) 

* Concept of your system
  * Partitioning
  * Functions
  * Work packages

* Design, implementation and validation
  * Mathmatical description, e.g. Matlab/Simulink model
  * SPICE modeling and simulation, LTspice circuit
  * Data analysis and validation, Serial monitor
