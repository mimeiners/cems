# Oversampling ADC‘s

## Overview

Oversampling A/D conversion

Decimation filters

Oversampling D/A conversion

## Recap

* Sampling theorem:
  * One good reason for sampling faster \(“oversampling”\):Can use lower order anti\-alias filter \(AAF\)\.


## Anti-Aliasing Filter

## Quantization Noise

## Digital Noise Filter (1)

## Noise Shaping

Idea: “Somehow” build an ADC that has most of its quantization noise at high frequencies\.

Key: Feedback

## Noise Shaping Using Feedback

## Discrete Time Integrator

## First Order “Delta-Sigma” Modulator

## NTF Frequency Domain Analysis

1st order noise shaping

Quantization noise is attenuated at low frequencies\, amplified at high frequencies\.

## In-Band Quantization Noise

Assuming a full\-scale \(FS\) sinusoidal signal\, we have

Each 2 x increase in M \(OSR\) results in 8 x SQNR improvement\, 9 dB \(1\.5 bits\) per octave oversampling\.

## SQNR Improvement

* Example revisited:
  * Want a 16\-bit ADC\, fB=1 MHz
  * Use oversampled 8\-bit ADC\, 1st order noise shaping and \(ideal\) digital lowpass filter\.SQNR improvement compared
    to case without oversampling is \-5\.2 dB \+ 30 log\(M\) 
  * 8\-bit increase in resolution \( 48 dB SQNR improvement\) would necessitate M approx\. 60
* Not all that bad\!


| M | SQNR improvement | 
| :-: | :-: | 
| 16 | 31 dB \(~5 bits\) |
| 256 | 67 dB \(~11 bits\) |
| 1024 | 85 dB \(~14 bits\) |

## DAC Requirements

## Solution

* Trimming or calibration
  * Measure DAC levels during test or at power\-up\.
  * Apply correction values to each level using auxiliary DAC\.
* Dynamic Element Matching Algorithms
  * Shuffle DAC unit elements to obtain fairly precise “average” output levels\.
  * Two ways:Data independent shufflingData dependent shuffling
* Single bit DAC


## Single-Bit DAC

A single bit DAC has only two output levels\.

Even if these two levels are imprecise\, the error will only affect gain and offset of the DAC and modulator which is
tolerable in many applications\. 

## Modulator with Single-Bit Quantizer

Expected SQNR \(from slide 14 With B=1\)

E\.g\. with M=128\, SQNR=60dB

Implementation example\, cnf\. \(Schreier and Temes\, 2003\, p\. 31\)

Not all that great in terms of achievable SQNR\, but sufficient for some applications\, e\.g\. digital voltmeter \(van
de Plassche\, 2003\)

Simulink implementation example \(Boser\, EECS 247\, 2011\)

## Simulated Response

## Spectrum

Looks like there is some noise shaping\, but SQNR=55 dB is lower than the exspected 60 dB\.

## Amplitude and Frequency Dependence

* Erratic dependence on amplitude and frequency
  * Simple linear model fails to predict this behavior\.
* Issue: Quantization noise error sequence is not “sufficiently random”\, as assumed in the beginning of this discussion\.


## Quantization Error in 1st Order Modulator

A complicated\, but deterministic function of the input\.

## Aside: Quantizer Gain

* Another issue is that the gain of the single bit quantizer is ill\-defined\, but we assumed it to be unity in our analysis
* The actual quantizer gain can be found from simulations\, and then plugged back into the linear model for better
  agreement \(and stability analysis using root locus\, etc\.\)

## Tones

* Since the quantization error is correlated with the input\, the shaped quantization noise contains spurious tones\,
  some of which lie in the signal band\.
* The linear model cannot predict these tones\.
* It is generally difficult to predict tonal behavior for arbitrary inputs\, even with a nonlinear model\.
* Analytical results exist for DC and sine inputs\, see e\.g\.

## DC Input

DC input A = 1/11

Doesn’t look like spectrum of DC at all

The ADC “sings” ???Quantization noise is periodic

## Limit Cycle

DC input A=1/11

Periodic sequence

## Idle Tone Considerations

* Idle tones are known to be a significant issue in audio applications\.
  * The human ear can detect tones ~20dB below the thermal/quantization noise floor\.
* If idle tones are an issue\, there are several options for mitigating their impact
  * Larger oversampling ratio
  * Multi\-bit quantizer and DAC
  * Dither
    * Superimpose a pseudorandom signal at the quantizer input to "whiten" quantization noise
      * See e\.g\. Chapter 3 of Delta\-Sigma Data Converters by Norsworthy\, Schreier & Temes\.
    * Overdesign by making quantization noise much smaller than electronic noise from integrators
      * Noisy integrator\(s\) help randomize quantization error sequence
  * Higher order modulators
    * Naturally produce "more random" quantization error sequences


## Higher Order Modulators

* Motivation: Better SQNR for a given oversampling ratio \(M\)\, plus improved idle tone performance as a side benefit\.
* Commonly used architectures:
  * Single quantizer loop with higher order filtering
    * Essentially a logical extension to the 1st order noise shaping concept discussed previously\.
  * Cascaded\, multi\-stage modulators
    * Contain a separate quantizer in each stage\.


## Higher Order Noise Shaping

Lth order noise transfer function

## In-Band Quantization Noise

For an Lth order modulator\, every doubling of M results in an increase in SQNR of 6L \+ 3 dB \(L \+ 0\.5 bits\)\.

## SQNR with Single Bit Quantizer

## Building a 2nd Order Modulator

General idea: Start with a 1st order modulator and replace quantizer by another 1st order loop\.

## Stability

* Having more than two integrators in a feedback loop means that the loop can be unstable \(criterion = BIBO\)\.
* From the diagram of the previous slide\, it is clear that the stability of the loop mostly depends on L1\(z\)\, and therefore the characteristics of the NTF\.
* How about the nonlinear transfer characteristic of the quantizer?
  * Unfortunately\, there is no crisp mathematical result that would address this question for all possible configurations\.
  * One important\, and general aspect of having a nonlinearity in the loop is that the stability becomes dependent on the signal \(and also L0\)\!
* In practice\, designers rely on a combination of stability analyses using the linear model \(\!\)\, established “heuristics\,” and time domain simulations of the nonlinear model\.


## Stability Heuristics

* Single\-bit:
  * First order modulator is stable \(bounded integrator output\) with arbitrary inputs of less than ∆/2 in magnitude
  * Second order modulator is known to be stable with arbitrary inputs of less than ∆/20 in magnitude\, and for "reasonable"\, slow varying inputs of magnitude < 0\.8·∆/2\, integrator outputs are "likely" to stay within bounds
  * Lee's criterion: modulator is “likely” to be stable if max\[He\(ω\)\] < 1\.5
* Multi\-bit:
  * A modulator with Nth order differentiation using an N\+1 bit quantizer is stable for arbitrary inputs with amplitude less than half the quantizer input range \(Schreier\, p\. 104\)\.

## Building Models in Stages (1)

* When modeling a complex system like a higher\-order SDM\, model development proceeds in stages\.
  * Each stage builds on its predecessor\.
* The design goal is to detect and eliminate problems at the highest possible level of abstraction\.
  * Each successive stage consumes progressively more engineering time\.
* Rework and re\-verification in early stage models because problems found in later stages are expensive fix\.
* Don’t launch a multi\-stage rework cycle every time you find a single bug\.
* Proceed in stages:
  * Determine requirements and gather references
  * Design practicle system:
    * Ideal subcircuits
    * Test under worst\-case conditions
  * Model key subcircuit nonidealities
    * Do not overload models with mindless “nonidealities”\.
  * Circuit design

## Example

## Filter Requirements

* Pass band 0 \.\.\. 20 kHz\, transition band 20 \.\.\. 24\.1 kHz \(∆f=4\.1kHz\)\,stop band 24\.1 kHz \.\.\. 5\.65 MHz
* A digital FIR filter that meets these requirements would require more than fs/∆f = 11\.3MHz/4\.1kHz ≅ 2800 coefficients

## Oversampling

Oversampling greatly reduces reconstruction filter requirements

How to create oversampled DAC input from a Nyquist rate signal?


## Interpolation

* Can increase the sampling rate of a discrete time signal by a factor of M\, by inserting M\-1 zero\-valued samples between the actual Nyquist rate samples \("zero stuffing"\)
  * Causes an M\-fold periodic repetition of the baseband spectrum

* Why is this a good idea?
* Can remove images and get wide transition band to play with
  * Simple reconstruction filter
  * Possibility of noise shaping
    * Build a high resolution DAC using a low resolution D/A interface


## Example

* Digital noise shaper is essentially a digital sigma\-delta loop
  * Shapes „truncation noise“ that results from truncating16\-bit word to a 1\-bit output
