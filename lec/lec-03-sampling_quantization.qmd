# Sampling and Quantization

## The Data Conversion Problem

* Real world signals
  * Continuous time\, continuous amplitude
* Digital abstraction
  * Discrete time\, discrete amplitude
* Two problems:
  * How to discretize in time and amplitude \-> A/D conversion
  * How to "undescretize" in time and amplitude \-> D/A conversion


## Overview

We'll first look at these building blocks from a functional\, “black box” perspective;refine later and look at implementations

## Uniform Sampling and Quantization

* Most common way of performing A/D conversion:
  * Sample signal uniformly in time
  * Quantize signal uniformly in amplitude
* Key questions:
  * How much “noise” is added due to amplitude quantization?
  * How can we reconstruct the signal back into analog form?
  * How fast do we need to sample?Must avoid [aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing)\!

## Consequence

## Sampling Theorem

## Brick Wall Anti-Alias Filter

## Practical Anti-Alias Filter

Need to sample faster than Nyquist rate to get good attenuation=>  _Oversampling_

## How much Oversampling?

Can tradeoff sampling speed against filter order\.

In high\-speed converters\, making fs/fsig\,max>10 is usually impossible or too costly\.

Means that we need fairly high order filters\.

Ref\. “CMOS Integrated ADC and DAC”\, v\.d\. Plassche\, 2003


## Classes of Sampling

* Nyquist\-rate sampling \(fs > 2·fsig\,max\)
  * Nyquist data converters
  * In practice always slightly oversampled
* Oversampling \(fs >> 2·fsig\,max\)
  * Oversampled data converters
  * Anti\-alias filtering is often trivial
  * Oversampling also helps reduce "quantization noise”
* Undersampling\, subsampling \(fs < 2·fsig\,max\)
  * Exploit aliasing to mix RF/IF signals down to baseband


## Subsampling

* Aliasing is "non\-destructive" if signal is band limited around some carrier frequency
* Downfolding of noise is a severe issue in practical subsampling mixers
  * Typically achieve noise figure no better than 20 dB \(\!\)


## The Reconstruction Problem

## Zero-Order Hold Reconstruction

* The most practical way of reconstructing the continuous time signal is to simply  _hold_  the discrete time values:
  * Either for full period Ts or a fraction thereof
  * Other schemes exist\, e\.g\.  _partial\-order hold_
* What does this do to the signal spectrum?
* We'll analyze this in two steps:
  * First look at infinitely narrow reconstruction pulses


## Dirac Pulses

## Spectrum

Spectrum of Dirac signal contains replicas of Vin\(f\) at integer multiples of the sampling frequency\.

## Finite Hold Pulse

## Envelope with Hold Pulse Tp=Ts

## Example

__Spectrum of Continuous Time Pulse Train __  __\(Arbitrary Example\)__

__ZOH Transfer Function__  __\("Sinc Distortion"\)__

__ZOH Output\, __  __Spectrum of Staircase Approximation__

original spectrum

## Reconstruction Filter

* Also called smoothing filter
* Same situation as with anti\-alias filter
  * A brick wall filter would be nice
  * Oversampling helps reduce filter order


## Summary

* Must obey sampling theorem fs > 2·fsig\,max\,
  * Usually dictates anti\-aliasing filter
* If sampling theorem is met\, continuous time signal can be recovered from discrete time sequence without loss of information
* A zero order hold in conjunction with a smoothing filter is the most common way to reconstruct
  * May need to add pre\- or post\-emphasis to cancel droop due to sinc envelope
* Oversampling helps reduce order of anti\-aliasing and reconstruction filters

* Next\, look at
  * Transfer functions of quantizer and DAC
  * Impact of quantization error

## Quantization of an Analog Signal

* Quantization step D
* Quantization error has sawtooth shape bounded by
* Ideally:
  * Infinite input range and infinite number of quantization levels
* In practice:
  * Finite input range and finite number of quantization levels
  * Output is a digital word \(not an analog voltage\)


## Conceptual Model of a Quantizer

* Encoding block determines how quantized levels are mapped into digital codes
* Note that this model is not meant to represent an actual hardware implementation
  * Its purpose is to show that quantization and encoding are conceptually separate operations
  * Changing the encoding of a quantizer has no interesting implications on its function or performance


## Encoding Example for a B-Bit Quantizer

## Nomenclature

![](img/lec-03-sampling_quantization_15.png)

\[IEEE Standard 1241\-2000\]

## Implementation Specific Technicalities

* So far\, we avoided specifying the absolute location of the code range with respect to "zero" input\.
* The zero input location depends on the particular implementation of the quantizer\.
  * Bipolar input\, mid\-rise or mid\-tread quantizer
  * Unipolar input
* The next slide shows the case with
  * Bipolar input
    * The quantizer accepts positive and negative inputs\, represents the common case of a differential circuit\.
  * Mid\-rise characteristic
    * The center of the transfer function \(zero\)\, coincides with a transition level\.


## Bipolar Mid-Rise Quantizer

## Bipolar Mid-Tread Quantizer

## Unipolar Quantizer

* Usually define origin where first code and straight line fit intersect
  * Otherwise\, there would be a systematic offset
* Usable range is reduced by D/2 below zero


## Effect of Quantization Error on Signal

* Two aspects
  * How much noise power does quantization add to samples?
  * How is this noise power distributed in frequency?
* Quantization error is a deterministic function of the signal
  * Should be able to answer above questions using a deterministic analysis\.
  * But\, unfortunately\, such an analysis strongly depends on the chosen signal and can be very complex\.
* Strategy
  * Build basic intuition using simple deterministic signals\.
  * Next\, abandon idea of deterministic representation and revert to a "general" statistical model \(to be used with caution\)\.


## Ramp Input

## Sine Wave Input

Integration is not straightforward…

## Quantization Error Histogram

Sinusoidal input signal with fsig=101 Hz\, sampled at fs=1000 Hz\, 8\-bit quantizer

Distribution is “almost” uniform; can approximate average power by integrating uniform distribution\.

## Statistical Model of Quantization Error

* Assumption: eq\(x\) has a uniform probability density\,
* This approximation holds reasonably well in practice when
  * Signal spans large number of quantization steps
  * Signal is "sufficiently active"
  * Quantizer does not overload


## Reality Check (1)

Input sequence consists of 1000 samples drawn from Gaussian distribution\, 4s=FSR

Error power close to that of uniform approximation

Another sine wave example\, but now fsig/fs=100/1000

What's going on here?

## Analysis (1)

* Sampled signal is repetitive and has only a few distinct values
  * This also means that the quantizer generates only a few distinct values of eq; not a uniform distribution

fsig/fs=100/1000

## Analysis (2)

Signal repeats every m samples\, where m is the smallest integer that satisfies

This means that eq\(n\) has at best 10 distinct values\, even if we take many more samples

## Dynamic Range Definition ideal ADC

## Dynamic Rang ideal ADC

| __B \(Number of Bits\)__ | __SQNR__ |
| :-: | :-: |
| 8 | 50 dB |
| 12 | 74 dB |
| 16 | 98 dB |
| 20 | 122 dB |

## Quantization Noise Spectrum

* How is the quantization noise power distributed in frequency?
  * First think about applying a sine wave to a quantizer\, without sampling \(output is continuous time\)


\+ many more harmonics

Quantization results in an "infinite" number of harmonics

Ref\. Y\. Tsividis\, ICASSP 2004

* Now sample the signal at the output
  * All harmonics \(an "infinite" number of them\) will alias into band from 0 to fs/2
  * Quantization noise spectrum becomes "white"

Interchanging sampling and quantization won’t change this situation

Ref\. Y\. Tsividis\, ICASSP 2004

* Can show that the quantization noise power is indeed distributed \(approximately\) uniformly in frequency
  * Again\, this is provided that the quantization error is "sufficiently random”

## Ideal DAC

Essentially a digitally controlled voltage\, current or charge source\.Example below is for unipolar DAC

Ideal DAC does not introduce quantization error\!

## Static Nonidealities

* Static deviations of transfer characteristics from ideality
  * Offset
  * Gain error
  * Differential Nonlinearity \(DNL\)
  * Integral Nonlinearity \(INL\)
* Useful references
  * “The Importance of Data Converter Static Specifications”\, Analog Devices MT\-010
  * “Understanding Data Converters”\, Texas Instruments Application Report SLAA013\, 1995


## Offset and Gain Error

* Conceptually simple\, but lots of \(uninteresting\) subtleties in how exactly these errors should be defined
  * Unipolar vs\. bipolar\, endpoint vs\. midpoint specification
  * Definition in presence of nonlinearities
* General idea \(neglecting staircase nature of transfer functions\):


## ADC Offset and Gain Error

* Definitions based on bottom and top endpoints of transfer characteristic
  * ½ LSB before first transition and ½ LSB after last transition
  * Offset is the deviation of bottom endpoint from its ideal location
  * Gain error is the deviation of top endpoint from its ideal location with offset removed
* Both quantities are measured in LSB or as percentage of full\-scale range

Same idea\, except that endpoints are directly defined by analog output values at minimum and maximum digital input

Also note that errors are specified along the vertical axis


## Comments on Offset and Gain Errors

* Definitions on the previous slides are the ones typically used in industry
  * IEEE Standard suggest somewhat more sophisticated definitions based on least square curve fitting
    * Technically more suitable metric when the transfer characteristics are significantly non\-uniform or nonlinear
* Generally\, it is non\-trivial to build a converter with very good gain/offset specifications
  * Nevertheless\, since gain and offset affect all codes uniformly\, these errors tend to be easy to correct
    * E\.g\. using a digital pre\- or post\-processing operation
  * Also\, many applications are insensitive to a certain level of gain and offset errors
    * E\.g\. audio signals\, communication\-type signals\, \.\.\.
* More interesting aspect: linearity
  * DNL and INL


## Differential Nonlinearity (DNL)

* In an ideal world\, all ADC codes would have equal width; all DAC output increments would have same size\.
* DNL\(k\) is a vector that quantifies for each code k the deviation of this width from the "average" width \(step size\)\.
* DNL\(k\) is a measure of uniformity\, it does not depend on gain and offset errors\.
  * Scaling and shifting a transfer characteristic does not alter its uniformity and hence DNL\(k\)\.
* Let's look at an example


## ADC DNL Example (1)

| Code \(k\) | W \[V\] |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | undefined |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 0\.5 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 1\.5 |
| 5 | 0 |
| 6 | 1\.5 |
| 7 | undefined |



* What is the average code width?
  * ADC with perfect uniformity would divide the range between first and last transition into 6 equal pieces
  * Hence calculate average code width \(i\.e\. LSB size\) as

Now calculate DNL\(k\) for each code k using

## Result

* Positive/negative DNL implies wide/narrow code\, respectively
* DNL = \-1 LSB implies missing code
* Impossible to have DNL < \-1 LSB for an ADC
  * But possible to have DNL > \+1 LSB
* Can show that sum over all DNL\(k\) is equal to zero

| Code \(k\) | DNL / LSB |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0\.09 |
| 2 | \-0\.45 |
| 3 | 0\.09 |
| 4 | 0\.64 |
| 5 | \-1\.00 |
| 6 | 0\.64 |

## A Typical ADC DNL Plot

* People speak about DNL often only in terms of min/max number across all codes
  * E\.g\. DNL = \+0\.63/\-0\.91 LSB
* Might argue in some cases that any code with DNL < \-0\.9 LSB is essentially a missing code
  * Why ?

## Impact of Noise

* In essentially all moderate to high\-resolution ADCs\, the transition levels carry noise that is somewhat comparable to the size of an LSB
  * Noise "smears out" DNL\, can hide missing codes
* Especially for converters whose input referred \(thermal\) noise is larger than an LSB\, DNL is a "fairly useless" metric


![](img/lec-03-sampling_quantization_32.jpg)

\[W\. Kester\, "ADC Input Noise: The Good\, The Bad\, and The Ugly\. Is No Noise Good Noise?" Analogue Dialogue\, Feb\. 2006\]

## DAC DNL

* Same idea applies
  * Find output increments for each digital code
  * Find increment that divides range into equal steps
  * Calculate DNL for each code k using
* One difference between ADC and DAC is that DAC DNL can be less than \-1 LSB
  * How ?


## Non-Monotonic DAC

In a DAC\, DNL < \-1LSB implies non\-monotinicity

How about a non\-monotonic ADC?

* Code 2 has two transition levels  W\(2\) is ill defined
  * DNL is ill\-defined\!
* Not a very big issue\, because a non\-monotonic ADC is usually not what we'll design for in practice…


## Integral Nonlinearity (INL)

* General idea
  * For each "relevant point" of the transfer characteristic\, quantify distance from a straight line drawn through the endpoints
    * An alternative\, less common definition uses a least square fit line as a reference
  * Just as with DNL\, the INL of a converter is by definition independent of gain and offset errors


## ADC INL Example

"Straight line" reference is uniform staircase between first and last transition

INL for each code is

Obviously INL\(1\) = 0 and INL\(7\) = 0

INL\(0\) is undefined

Can show that

Means that once we computed DNL\, we can easily find INL using a cumulative sum operation on the DNL vector

Using DNL values from last lecture\, we find

| Code \(k\) | DNL \[LSB\] | INL \[LSB\] |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 0\.09 | 0 |
| 2 | \-0\.45 | 0\.09 |
| 3 | 0\.09 | \-0\.36 |
| 4 | 0\.64 | \-0\.27 |
| 5 | \-1\.00 | 0\.36 |
| 6 | 0\.64 | \-0\.64 |
| 7 | undefined | 0 |

## Result

## A Typical ADC DNL/INL Plot

* DNL/INL signature often reveals architectural details
  * E\.g\. major transitions
  * We'll see more examples in the context of DACs
* Since INL is a cumulative measure\, it turns out to be less sensitive than DNL to thermal noise "smearing"

\[Ishii\, Custom Integrated Circuits Conference\, 2005\]

## DAC INL

* Same idea applies
  * Find ideal output values that lie on a straight line between endpoints
  * Calculate INL for each code k using
* Interesting property related to DAC INL
  * If for all codes |INL| < 0\.5 LSB\, it follows that all |DNL| < 1 LSB
  * A sufficient \(but not necessary\) condition for monotonicity


## How to Measure DNL/INL in the Lab?

* DAC
  * Apply all input codes\, measure output with a precision voltmeter
* ADC
  * A little more tricky
  * One option is to build a servo loop that finds the code transitions
    * See e\.g\. Kester\, page 5\.36
  * A more popular approach is histogram testing


## Basic Histogram Test Setup

## Histogram Example

## Sinusoidal Input

Preferred over ramp or triangular test signals

It is easier much easier to generate a “high fidelity” sinusoid

The histogram now takes on a bathtub shape\, which can be mathematically inverted to find the DNL

## DNL/INL Code Test

## Limitations of ADC Histogram Testing

* Cannot detect non\-monotonicity
  * The histogram does not capture in which order the codes occurred
* Cannot detect erratic dynamics
  * E\.g\. 123\, 123\, …\, 123\, 0\, 124\, 124\, …
  * Must look directly at ADC output to detect these
* Similarly\, random noise is not detected and  _improves_  DNL

## Hiding DNL Problems in the Noise

INL suggests that there may be missing codes

But\, DNL is "smeared out" by noise and does not show this

Always look at both DNL/INL

INL usually does not lie
