# Sampling Circuits

# Circuit Level Considerations

* How to build circuits that “sample”?
* Ideal Dirac sampling is impractical
  * Need a switch that opens\, closes and acquires signal within an infinitely small time\.
* Discrete time integrators
  * Finite OTA gain
  * Electronic noise
  * OTA dynamic settling error\, nonideality due to slewing

# Discussion



* One of the most significant inventions in the history of ICs
* Predominant approach for precision signal processing in CMOS
  * CMOS technology provides good switches & capacitors
* SC circuits have many advantages over RC implementations
  * Transfer function set by  _ratio_  of capacitors
    * RC product suffers from large process variations
  * Corner frequencies \(of filters\) can be adjusted by changing clock frequency
  * Can make large time constants without using large resistors
    * RC lowpass\, 100Hz: R=16MΩ\, C=100pF
    * SC lowpass\, 100Hz: f=10kHz\, C1=6\.25pF\, C2=100pF

# Inverting Configuration



* Compared to the circuit on slide 3\, the effect of V1 is “inverted” because C is flipped upside down during f2 \(\+ terminal at GND\)
  * Provides signal inversion

# Frequency Response ?



* Looking at the transient waveforms is fun\, but what can we say about the frequency response of the SC circuit?
* Looks like a tough question since the output signal looks “complicated”
  * Not just a sine wave with shifted phase and altered magnitude\, as in the RC case
  * Instead we have a staircase waveform with “rounded” edges \(due to finite switch resistance\)
* Part of the problem is that SC circuits are time variant
  * The configuration is periodically switched between two states
* Time variant circuits\, in principle\, introduce new frequencies
  * Think about spectral components caused by the voltage “steps” at the output

# First Pass Analysis

* Let’s try to find the relationship between Vin\(t1\) and Vout\(t2\)
  * This means we are looking at the relationship between “discrete time samples” of the voltages and ignore the fact that the output is really a continuous time signal

# Circuit Analysis (1)

During f1\, VC1 tracks Vin

If we assume that the tracking is reasonably fast\, such that there is only a negligible difference between the input and VC1\, we can write

Source: EE315a\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

During f2\, the output voltage and VC1 are equalized

Again\, assuming that the circuit settles precisely\, we can write

The sum of the charges must be equal to the charges that were previously on C1 and C2\, before the phi2 switch turned on\, i\.e\.

* Sampling output during phase 1
* Finite gain results in “leaky integrator”
  * Some fraction of previous output is lost in new cycle\.


# Frequency Domain View

Limited gain at low\-frequencies

But noise\-shaping relies on high integrator gain at low frequencies …

# Required DC Gain

Good practice to make OTA gain at least a few times larger than oversampling ratio\.

# Circuit with MOS Switch / Nonidealities

# Finite Acquisition Time

# Hold Mode Leakage

# Sampling Jitter



* In any sampling circuit\, electronic noise causes random timing variations in the actual sampling clock edge
  * Adds "noise" to samples\, especially if dVin/dt is large
* Analysis
  * Consider sine wave input signal
  * Assume ∆t is random with zero mean and standard deviation σ


# Charge Cancellation


* Cancellation is never perfect\, since channel charge of M1 will not exactly split 50/50
  * E\.g\. if Rs is very small\, most of M1’s channel charge will flow toward the input voltage source
* Not a precision technique\, just an attempt to do a partial clean\-up


# Differential Sampling

# CMOS Switch

* Design
  * Size P/N ratio to minimize change in R over input range
  * Size P and N simultaneously to meet distortion specs
* PMOS brings limited benefit unless the input signal range is large or centered near VDD


# Clock Generation

# Fully Differential Circuit
