* Special requirements in active\-RC and SC circuits
  * Tend to narrow design space\.
* Active\-RC \(resistive loads\)
  * Difficult to achieve sufficient gain with a single\-stage OTA\.
* SC \(fast transient settling\)
  * Must stay away from “tricks” such as pole\-zero cancellation\.
    * Pole zero doublets can cause long setting tails \(more later\)\.
  * Hard to achieve fast settling for three or more stages\.
* We will take these issues into account as we discuss the various OTA implementation styles\.

# Fully Differential vs. Single Ended

* Symmetrical
  * Immune to coupling and power supply noise
  * Easy to analyze
* Can invert signal via wire crossing
* Requires common mode feedback \(CMFB\)


Lower complexity \(component count\)

Can build non\-inverting unity gain buffer without using any feedback components

# Coupling Noise

Similar arguments can be made regarding the rejection of supply noise\, ground bounce\, substrate noise\, etc\.

Differential Signaling

Single Ended Signaling

# Fully Differential vs. Single Ended

* Most precision analog integrated circuits are based on fully differential stages
  * Filters\, data converters\, etc\.
* In contrast\, printed circuit board circuits tend to be single ended
  * Want minimum complexity and component count
* Since this course emphasizes integrated circuit design\, we will tailor our analyses toward fully differential implementations

# Negative Feedback

Harold S\. Black\, “Stabilized Feed\-Back Amplifiers”\, 1934

Interesting case:

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Interpretation

* As long as we have  <span style="color:#008000">large</span>  gain in the forward path a\, the overall  gain will depend only on f\.
* Since vout/vin ~1/f\, we often make f ≤ 1
  * E\.g\. for a "closed loop" gain of two\, we need f = 0\.5
* f ≤ 1 is easy to implement\, and ratiometric\!
  * A  <span style="color:#008000">wire</span>  \(f=1\) or resistive or capacitive voltage divider\.


# Example

Case 1: a=100

Case 2: a=1000

10x variation in forward gain\, and only about 1\.8% change in closed loop gain\!

Quelle: EE114\, B\. Murmann\, Stanford Univ\.

# Gain Sensitivity

* Fractional change in gain is reduced by product of a and f\, which can be made arbitrarily large \(conceptually\)
  * Loop gain T
* We will find that loop gain is a very meaningful parameter that will also appear in bandwidth and impedance calculations
  * More later …

# Effect of Negative Feedback on Nonlinearity

Substitute \(2\) into \(1\)\, then compare coefficients to get

Linear term as expected\, reduced by \(1\+T\)

Cubic term reduced by \(1\+T\)4\!

# Negative Feedback and Bandwidth

* Closed loop transfer function:
* Bandwidth increases by \(1\+T\)\!
  * But gain is reduced by \(1\+T\)
* Product of gain and bandwidth remains constant

# Inverting Configuration

* Circuit does not map directly into generic block diagram
  * Cannot directly identify a and f\, if we only use voltages    \(due to fact that O/A is voltage\-voltage; the feedback is current as a function of output voltage\)
  * av ≠ g
  * Two sample solutions \(examples = not yet methodology\)

# Operating Point Sensitivity

The operating point is very sensitive to small changes in the device characteristics\.

Solution: Common mode feedback \(CMFB\)

# CMFB Implementation



* In practice\, we won’t be able to let GCMFB  ∞ for loop stability
  * Nonetheless\, the loop will get us to within a few mV of where we need to be
  * And most importantly help absorb variations in the device characteristics
* In the first few lectures on OTA design\, we will use the idealized common mode feedback circuit \(as shown previously\) to avoid distraction from the main design task
* Practical CMFB implementation examples \(using transistors\) will follow later in this course

# Differential Mode Small-Signal Half Circuit

With the circuit at the proper operating point\, we can analyze its small\-signal behavior using a differential mode half circuit model\.

Note that \(to first order\) the CMFB loop does not influence the behavior of the differential mode signals\.

# OTA with Capacitive Feedback

* Let’s get started by placing our simple OTA into a capacitive feedback loop \(as encountered e\.g\. in an SC circuit\)\.
* Questions:
  * What is the phase margin?
  * What is the closed loop transfer function?
  * What is the total integrated noise?
  * How fast does this circuit settle \(in response to a step\)?

# Return Ratio Analysis

# Return Ratio Analysis (1)

* Does not attempt to identify forward gain and feedback network transfer functions separately\.
* Analysis aims to identify gain around feedback loop
  * Loop gain\, loop transmission\,
    * Different terminology for the same thing\.
* From the loop gain of a circuit\, we can determine:
  * Stability\, closed loop gain characteristics\, node impedances\.
* Analysis can be applied to arbitrary feedback circuits\, independent of topology\, port structure\, etc\.
* We will first look at the complete framework of this technique\,
  * then identify a way to partition the analysis for our needs and reduce its algebraic overhead

* Set all independent sources to zero
* Identify a  _controlled source_  in the feedback loop that you want to analyze and break the loop by disconnecting the source
  * E\.g\. VCCS\, VCVS\, …
* Inject a test signal st at the breakpoint
  * Current or voltage\, depending on type of removed source
* Find the return signal sr generated by the controlled source that was disconnected from the circuit in step 2\.
* The  _return ratio_  of the controlled source is given by  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __RR = –__ </span>  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __s__ </span>  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __r__ </span>  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __/__ </span>  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __s__ </span>  <span style="color:#cc0000"> __t__ </span>
  * _Provided that_  we have chosen a controlled source that breaks the loop under consideration \(and no other loop\)\, the return ratio of the source is equal to the loop gain of the circuit\, i\.e\. RR = T
  * Comment: we must have T \(not just any RR\) for the stability analysis

* High\- and low\-frequency behavior similar to telescopic OTA
  * But noise is much worse
* Advantage: Input common mode can be chosen without taking away output signal range
* If slewing is not an issue\, the current in the output branches can be reduced below ITAIL/2
