The course makes heavy use of circuit simulation, using [**Xschem**](https://xschem.sourceforge.io) for schematic entry and [**ngspice**](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io) for simulation. The 130nm CMOS technology [**SG13G2**](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK) from [IHP Microelectronics](https://www.ihp-microelectronics.com) is used.

Tools and PDK are integrated in the [**IIC-OSIC-TOOLS**](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) Docker image, which will be used during the coursework.
